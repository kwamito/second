Another project for web development in python.
In the templates folder we have an html file that
uses jinja for loops to repeat elements in the 
json file.
This is just a simple web development project with python flask.
To run this install python and add it to path, then create a new folder or directory and install
a python virtual environment in it. Use pip to install flask ($ pip install flask). Then download these files and copy them to your virtual environment folder and run them.
